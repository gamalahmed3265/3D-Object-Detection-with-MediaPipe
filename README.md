# 3D Object Detection with MediaPipe

Creating a virtual environment in Python is a good practice to isolate your project dependencies. You can use venv (if you're using Python 3.3 or newer) or virtualenv to create a virtual environment. Here's a basic example using venv:

### Using venv (for Python 3.3 and newer):
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment.

3. Run the following commands:
```bash
# On Windows
    python -m venv myenv

# On macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv myenv
```

## Activate the virtual environment:
1. On Windows:

```bash
    myenv\Scripts\activate
```
1. On macOS/Linux:

```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate
```
Now you can install packages into this virtual environment using `pip`

```bash
pip install mediapipe
